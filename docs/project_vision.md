# Project Concept and Boundaries

## Description

GitHub is a social media site, where users share their code, have discussions in issues and pull requests and having fun. 
During the Covid19 times and a lockdown, GitHub has grown *twice* in size. Imagine how many more interesting projects have come during that time!

Our project, StatsNinja, aims to collect statistics about GitHub, process it and present our customers with insightful info.
We analyzed all the most popular repositories and their contributors to provide the best data to you!

The customer should register and choose their billing plan:
* **Half**
  * We provide you with half of our data of your choice, e.g. Real World Map and Literacy
* **Full**
  * You have access to all our data
* **Custom**
  * Your task, our data

A guest can request their info to be removed from our servers. In order to do so they need to confirm their GitHub account.

## Goals and Tasks

* Short on staff? Need a developer in a particular location?
  * We have a real world map with developers and their technology stack
* Need to hire a response team for issues and pull requests in your repo?
  * We've analyzed the response time of every developer in popular repos
* Curious how literate your workers on GitHub?
  * Aren't you picky? We collected all the text any developer wrote and gave it a literacy score
* Or can't help but keep wondering what social graph your developers create?
  * Yup, that we also have! Can these connections be a reason why a leaving of one person leads to leaving of a whole team?
